            "3.1 Topical retinoids Andrea M. Hui and Alan R. Shalita ACNE VULGARIS: PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Acne vulgaris is a common dermatological complaint, accounting for over 30% of all visits to dermatologists. It is a multifactorial disease in which genetics and hormonal changes play a role in its development. The clinical lesions of acne develop from several steps, beginning with androgen stimulation of the sebaceous glands at or around puberty (1)",
            "1.3 Innate immunity in the pathogenesis of acne vulgaris Sheila Krishna, Christina Kim, and Jenny Kim INTRODUCTION Acne vulgaris is a disease of pilosebaceous units. Major hypotheses on its pathophysiology include the following (1,2): 1. Altered follicular keratinization (hyperkeratinization) of the pilosebaceous unit (3) 2. Propionibacterium acnes ( P. acnes ) follicular colonization and activity (4) 3. Hormonal influence (5 7) 4. Sebum production (8) 5",
            "1.1 Introduction: epidemiology, cost, and psychosocial implications Whitney P. Bowe and Alan R. Shalita Acne vulgaris is a ubiquitous, multifactorial disorder of the pilosebaceous unit. The source of the word acne is controversial. It may be derived from the Greek achne , a word meaning efflorescence, or the Greek acme (Latin acme), which implies a summit or peak",
            "acnes ), and the inflammatory response. These four factors should not be seen as distinct phases, but rather as closely interrelated mechanisms that ultimately lead to the clinical disease acne vulgaris. That comedones are essential lesions in acne was first suggested in 1960 (1) . COMEDONES: AN OVERVIEW Acne vulgaris begins with the formation of microcomedones, subclinical lesions characterized by follicular epithelial hyperproliferation. These lesions can further evolve into inflammatory lesions or noninflammatory comedones, of which there are two types, open and closed. Clinically invisible, microcomedones are lesions present in regions of apparently healthy skin in a patient with acne",
            "1.4 Comedogenesis Carol Heughebaert and Alan R. Shalita INTRODUCTION Despite extensive research over the past century, the pathogenesis of acne vulgaris remains unclear. In particular, the sequences of events that are involved in comedogenesis have yet to be elucidated. Comedogenesis is one of the four primary etiological factors of acne; the others are increased sebum production and secretion, follicular duct colonization with Propionibacterium acnes ( P. acnes ), and the inflammatory response"

            "THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ACNE AND DIET CONCLUSION It has long been posited that diet has no impact on acne, but recent clinical trials have suggested that a relationship does indeed exist. While the clinical evidence is compelling, much of what we can attribute to diet as a factor in acne severity draws from inferences based on our expanding knowledge of hormonal and endocrinologic pathways. The association between glycemic load and acne is especially convincing",
            "Conversely, certain dietary components may help reduce acne severity. Omega-3 fatty acids, found in fish, walnuts, and flaxseeds, have anti-inflammatory properties that may counteract the inflammatory processes involved in acne. Antioxidants, such as vitamins A and E, also play a role in reducing oxidative stress, which has been linked to acne pathogenesis.",
            "Although the link between dairy and acne is less convincing than that between a high glycemic load diet and acne, both deserve consideration during any dietary counseling efforts. The exact mechanism by which dairy may impact acne, whether it is via a hormonal pathway or upregulated IGF-1, remains to be further clarified",
            "THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ACNE AND DIET FATTY ACIDS The effects of glycemic load may extend beyond hormonal pathways to include an effect on sebum composition, which was recently shown to be related to acne severity (34). That is, adolescent males who consumed a low glycemic load diet produced sebum with a higher ratio of skin surface fatty acids (SFAs) to monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), and they also had fewer acne lesions",
            "Here we present the most up-to-date and strongest evidence regarding a relationship between acne and the intake of carbohydrates, dairy, o -3 fatty acids, antioxidants, zinc, vitamin A, and iodine. CARBOHYDRATES AND ACNE The strongest evidence favoring a relationship between diet and acne lies in a correlation between acne severity and carbohydrate intake . It has been observed through a survey-based study that acne severity may be related to intake of foods high in sugar (5), but the research in this area has broadened to quantify carbohydrate intake in general. Most of the studies in the area of carbohydrate intake utilize the glycemic index (GI) as a tool for quantifying serum glucose and insulin levels for various foods and then relating these measurements to clinical outcome"

            "INFANTILE ACNE Clinical Presentation Infantile acne may start in the first month of life or later and can persist for months to years, usually resolves by 24 months of age. It is a relatively rare condition and presents more often in boys than in girls. There may be inflammatory papules, pustules, cysts, and/or nodules, and, unlike in neonatal acne, comedones are usually present (Fig. 8.1.1). Lesions present on the cheeks primarily but can also be found on the forehead, chin, and trunk",
            "NEONATAL ACNE Clinical Presentation Neonatal acne, also known as acne neonatorum , presents between the time of birth and approximately the first four to six weeks of life. It has been estimated that neonatal acne affects as many as 20% of newborns (1). eonatal acne may actually be a term used for a heterogeneous set of conditions presenting with papules and pustules, as well as true early acne presenting with comedones",
            "SUMMARY Acne in the younger patient presents unique challenges. While neonatal acne appears to have a pathophysiology and a morphology that may be unrelated to acne at all, infantile, mid-childhood, and preadolescent acne share in being potential markers for underlying hormonal abnormalities. Once underlying endocrine etiologies are ruled out, however, the basic management principles for these types of acne are similar to those used for older teenagers and adults",
            "This special group of acne patients may be categorized into the following four clinical entities on the basis of the time of onset and clinical features: neonatal, infantile, mid-childhood, and preadolescent acne (Table 8.1.1). The clinical presentation, pathophysiology, differential diagnosis, workup, and treatment of each of these types of acne differ to varying degrees and will therefore be addressed on an individual basis",
            "In the following section, a guide for initial evaluation of these patients will help define the source of androgens. HORMONAL EVALUATION OF THE ACNE PATIENT Infantile Acne Infantile acne, in children beyond the neonatal period, can present with comedones, papules, and pustules. It can persist through early childhood and be associated with scarring. Boys tend to be affected more commonly than girls"

        "Acne vulgaris is a multifactorial disorder with several key factors contributing to its development. These include: Follicular hyperkeratinization: Abnormal shedding of skin cells lining the hair follicles, leading to blockage. Excess sebum production: Overproduction of oil (sebum) by sebaceous glands. Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) colonization: Overgrowth of this bacterium within the blocked follicles. Inflammation: The body's immune response to P. acnes and sebum, leading to redness, swelling, and pus formation. Hormonal influence: Androgens (male hormones) stimulate sebaceous glands, contributing to acne, particularly during puberty.",
        "While the exact relationship between diet and acne is still being researched, recent studies suggest a link between certain dietary factors and acne severity: High glycemic index (GI) and glycemic load (GL) foods: Refined carbohydrates (white bread, sugary drinks, processed foods) can spike blood sugar and insulin levels, potentially influencing hormonal pathways and sebum production, leading to acne. Dairy products: Some studies suggest a correlation between dairy consumption, particularly skim milk, and acne. This may be due to hormones and growth factors present in milk. Omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acid ratio: A typical Western diet high in omega-6 fatty acids and low in omega-3s may promote inflammation, potentially contributing to acne. More research is needed to fully understand the impact of diet on acne, but it's generally advisable to consume a balanced diet with low GI/GL foods, moderate dairy intake, and a healthy balance of omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids",
        "Here are the key differences between neonatal and infantile acne: Feature Neonatal Acne Infantile Acne Age of Onset Birth to 4-6 weeks 1 month to 2 years (rarely beyond) Lesion Types Primarily papules and pustules (sometimes comedones) Comedones, papules, pustules, nodules, and cysts Distribution Face, neck, scalp, chest, back Primarily cheeks, also forehead, chin, and trunk Pathophysiology May be related to maternal hormones, excess sebum, and/or colonization with Pityrosporum (Malassezia) yeast. Primarily due to increased adrenal androgen production. Treatment Usually resolves on its own; topical azoles (e.g., ketoconazole) may be used for Pityrosporum. Topical benzoyl peroxide, retinoids, and antibiotics; oral erythromycin for severe cases; rarely isotretinoin. Prognosis Typically resolves within weeks without scarring. May persist for months to years; may predict more severe adolescent acne.",
        "Treating acne during pregnancy requires careful consideration of medication safety for both the mother and the developing fetus. Here are the general recommendations: Topical Treatments: Benzoyl peroxide: Generally considered safe (category C), but use lower concentrations and monitor for irritation. Topical erythromycin and clindamycin: Safe (category B) and effective options. Azelaic acid: Safe (category B) and may be helpful. Topical metronidazole: Safe (category B) and an option for acne with rosacea features. Oral Treatments: Erythromycin: The preferred oral antibiotic (category B) if systemic treatment is needed. Zinc salts: Considered safe (category A) and may be beneficial. Avoid: Topical retinoids (tretinoin, adapalene, tazarotene): Not recommended due to potential risks, especially tazarotene (category X). Tetracyclines: Contraindicated (category D) due to effects on developing bones and teeth. Isotretinoin: Absolutely contraindicated (category X) due to high risk of birth defects. Important Notes: Always consult with an obstetrician before starting or changing any acne medication during pregnancy. Intralesional corticosteroids may be used for large, inflammatory lesions. "

        "The main causes of acne vulgaris include: Altered Follicular Keratinization: Hyperkeratinization of the pilosebaceous unit leads to clogged follicles. Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes): Follicular colonization and activity of this bacterium contribute to inflammation. Hormonal Influence: Hormonal changes, particularly during puberty, stimulate sebaceous gland activity.Increased Sebum Production: Higher production of sebum can exacerbate acne development. These factors are interconnected and collectively contribute to the pathogenesis of acne vulgaris.",
        "Diet influences acne development through various mechanisms, particularly by the intake of carbohydrates and dairy products. Clinical studies have demonstrated a significant correlation between high glycemic load diets and increased acne severity, as foods with high glycemic indices elevate serum glucose and insulin levels, potentially exacerbating acne. While the relationship between dairy consumption and acne is less established, it may involve hormonal pathways such as increased insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). Additionally, dietary fatty acids and their composition can affect sebum production, further linking diet to acne severity. Overall, the strongest evidence suggests that limiting high glycemic foods may benefit those prone to acne.",
        "Differences Between Neonatal and Infantile Acne Neonatal Acne: Onset: Typically presents between birth and the first four to six weeks of life. Prevalence: Affects up to 20% of newborns. Clinical Features: Characterized by papules and pustules; comedones (blackheads) may or may not be present. It has a heterogeneous presentation and may not necessarily be true acne. Pathophysiology: The causes may be unrelated to traditional acne mechanisms, often linked to maternal hormones rather than an individual’s hormonal changes. Duration: Usually resolves on its own within a few weeks to months. Infantile Acne: Onset: Can begin in the first month of life or later, with a possibility of persisting for months to years, typically resolving by 24 months of age. Prevalence: Relatively rare compared to neonatal acne, with a higher incidence in boys. Clinical Features: Presence of comedones alongside inflammatory papules, pustules, cysts, and nodules; lesions are mainly found on the cheeks but can also appear on the forehead, chin, and trunk. Pathophysiology: May indicate underlying hormonal abnormalities, particularly in children beyond the neonatal phase; this type can be associated with scarring. Evaluation: Requires consideration of potential underlying endocrine issues. Management principles are similar to those used for older children and adults once underlying causes are ruled out. Understanding these distinctions is important for accurate diagnosis and tailored management approaches in pediatric patients presenting with acne.",
        "The management of acne during pregnancy requires careful consideration of the safety profiles of various medications, as controlled studies in pregnant women are often limited. Based on the evidence presented, the following treatments are recommended for acne in pregnancy: 1. Topical Treatments: Topical Erythromycin: Classified as Category B, this antimicrobial is considered safe for use during pregnancy. Clindamycin: Also a Category B agent, clindamycin is regarded as safe and effective for treating acne in pregnant patients. Benzoyl Peroxide: This treatment falls under Category C, indicating that risk cannot be ruled out; however, it is often deemed acceptable for use in pregnancy. 2. Oral Antibiotics: The use of oral antibiotics for acne during pregnancy is not generally recommended. Although there are suggestions regarding the safety of oral erythromycin, these claims lack substantial evidence for prolonged use during pregnancy. 3. Combination Therapy: For cases of moderatetosevere acne vulgaris, a combination of topical therapies with a focus on the aforementioned agents may be indicated, particularly if the condition poses a risk of scarring. Importantly, physicians are often cautious when prescribing medications during pregnancy, and dermatologists may be consulted for managing gestational acne. Individual treatment decisions should consider the severity of acne and the potential risks and benefits to both the mother and fetus. In summary, topical agents (erythromycin and clindamycin) are preferred, while oral antibiotics should be avoided unless absolutely necessary, especially in cases of severe acne. Regular followups and reassessments are essential to ensure safe and effective management throughout the pregnancy."
